Ensure all code is written in TypeScript with strict typing.

Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).

Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.

Under what conditions does this work?

Do not handle only the happy path.

Do not claim correctness you haven't verified.

Do not write code before stating assumptions.

Don't write comments if our standard is to avoid them
